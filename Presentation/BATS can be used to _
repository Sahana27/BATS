BATS can be used to :
test command line commands 
status of the command 
Output of command can be verified 
Output
Lines
Share common method across file

BATS TEST EVALUATION :
       n +1
First run, gives the count of test cases
Then, iterates over the test cases and executes each one in its own process.



 Invoke bats interpreter with multiple test arguments or with path to a directory containing multiple .bats files.

Bats will run each test file individually and aggregate the results

If test case fails, bats exits with a 1 status code.


run,lines


run is Helper that invokes its argument as a command.

Saves the exit status in status variable

Output of it is stored in output global variable.It also has the standard error message.

Using this we can continue to make assertion in your test cases.

lines is an array it is used for easily accessing indivual line of output.


Set up and Tear DOwn
Special function are setup and teardown

Setup run before running any test case

Teardown run after each test case

Setup can be used to setup your environment

Teardown can be used to clean up


Key points
To run test cases, bat package has to be installed.
All the Test cases needs to be stored in .bat file
All test cases should begin with @test
Setup and teardown is always executed at the beginning and at the end of each test cases respectively.
Setup : sets up environment
Teardown : cleans up after testing
